                <b>The Story of Cricket – From Past to Present:</b>
                Cricket, one of the most beloved sports in the world, began in England during the 16th century.
                Originally a rural pastime, it slowly evolved into a structured sport with formal rules. The first
                recorded match took place in 1646,
                and by the 18th century, cricket had gained popularity across England.
